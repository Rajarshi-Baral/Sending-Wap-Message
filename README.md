# Sending-Wap-Message
Python and Java code to send a single message multiple times.

1) The Java code is best suitable for notepads or other text editor softwares. Although it send messages through whatsapp but there is some problems occurs.

2) For solving that problems, I implement this code in Python langage.

    For run this python code:    

   install the required libraries:
            i) pyautogui: Used for GUI automation.
            ii) pyperclip: Used for clipboard operations.


   You can install these using pip:

                pip install pyautogui pyperclip

   run the upper line cmd code in the terminal to install the necessary libraries.
